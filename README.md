# SpringOnions

- Beginner task
----

#### This is just a little service to provide some endpoints with OpenApi/Swagger

Can be used to test understanding of an api during an interview.
Could also be used as infrastructure for further tests using RestAssured or Postman.

- might deploy this on azure at some point if need be.

#### Preparation
0. start service _(obviously)_
1. open http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/
2. share your screen with the swagger-ui
3. let the applicant control your screen

#### Specific scenario

1. let the applicant create a new cat using the swagger-ui
2. let them get the cat or all cats

Just let them play around with it for a few minutes. 
Not everyone has worked with swagger before. 
The key is that they can demonstrate they understand the basics of an api.
